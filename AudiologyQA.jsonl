Fifteen children between the ages of 10 and 12 years participated in a laboratory setting with speakers set up at 30° angles surrounding the test chair. The task was twofold: a CRM (coordinate response measure; a measure of button press reaction time to identifying which speaker the target talker as noted by a call sign was originating) and speech recognition measure (repeating the word from the target talker) with the signal coming from speakers at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° azimuth; 12-talker speech babble was presented at 90° and 270° azimuth. Performance was measured to stimuli presented at a +3 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 65 dB SPL.\nResults indicated that the best speech recognition in noise was when the signal was directed to the normal-hearing ear regardless of device. The poorest performance was when the target and noise were co-located with the bone-conduction device.

Fifteen children between the ages of 10 and 12 years participated in a laboratory setting with speakers set up at 30° angles surrounding the test chair. The task was twofold: a CRM (coordinate response measure; a measure of button press reaction time to identifying which speaker the target talker as noted by a call sign was originating) and speech recognition measure (repeating the word from the target talker) with the signal coming from speakers at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° azimuth; 12-talker speech babble was presented at 90° and 270° azimuth. Performance was measured to stimuli presented at a +3 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 65 dB SPL.\nResults indicated that the best speech recognition in noise was when the signal was directed to the normal-hearing ear regardless of device. The poorest performance was when the target and noise were co-located with the bone-conduction device.

{"id": "MC461", "tag": "Others", "type": "MC", "question": "Use the passage below to answer Questions 1–4.\nResearchers conducted an experiment to examine how pediatric patients with unilateral hearing loss (anacusic ear) performed on speech-in-noise measures with a CROS device versus a bone-conduction device on a headband. Fifteen children between the ages of 10 and 12 years participated in a laboratory setting with speakers set up at 30° angles surrounding the test chair. The task was twofold: a CRM (coordinate response measure; a measure of button press reaction time to identifying which speaker the target talker as noted by a call sign was originating) and speech recognition measure (repeating the word from the target talker) with the signal coming from speakers at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° azimuth; 12-talker speech babble was presented at 90° and 270° azimuth. Performance was measured to stimuli presented at a +3 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 65 dB SPL.\nResults indicated that the best speech recognition in noise was when the signal was directed to the normal-hearing ear regardless of device. The poorest performance was when the target and noise were co-located with the bone-conduction device. Performance on the CRM reaction time metric was best for the CROS condition and poorest for the unaided condition. These findings support an advantage for the CROS device over the bone-conduction device for speech-in-noise tasks in children with unilateral hearing loss.\n\nWhat type of research was used in the described experiment?\nA) Experimental\nB) Nonexperimental\nC) Quasi-experimental\nD) Normative", "answer": "c", "explanations": "In the example, we know it is experimental in nature because we have independent and dependent variables that we are controlling.

Fifteen children between the ages of 10 and 12 years participated in a laboratory setting with speakers set up at 30° angles surrounding the test chair. The task was twofold: a CRM (coordinate response measure; a measure of button press reaction time to identifying which speaker the target talker as noted by a call sign was originating) and speech recognition measure (repeating the word from the target talker) with the signal coming from speakers at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° azimuth; 12-talker speech babble was presented at 90° and 270° azimuth. Performance was measured to stimuli presented at a +3 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 65 dB SPL.\nResults indicated that the best speech recognition in noise was when the signal was directed to the normal-hearing ear regardless of device. The poorest performance was when the target and noise were co-located with the bone-conduction device. Performance on the CRM reaction time metric was best for the CROS condition and poorest for the unaided condition. These findings support an advantage for the CROS device over the bone-conduction device for speech-in-noise tasks in children with unilateral hearing loss.\n\nSuppose the study above used 24 participants with normal hearing, plugged one ear with a foam hearing protection device, and used the two devices in two randomly assigned groups.
